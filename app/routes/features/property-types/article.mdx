## Property types

Better Properties add numerous additional property types. If you have an idea for a new type, let me know by [opening a feature request](https://github.com/unxok/obsidian-better-properties/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

_Note:_ as of now, specific built-in property types are left untouched. Generally, I would prefer to keep it that way. But, this could change if there's enough of a reason to justify doing it.

### Array

A list of values where each "sub-property" share the same type and settings. Each sub-property is rendered as if it's a property named `<parent>.#` (i.e. `favorite quotes.#`) but without the property name being shown.

![Array example](/type-array-example.png)

```yaml
---
favorite quotes:
  - Goodbye everyone, I'll remember you all in therapy.
  - No Patrick, mayonaise is not an instrument.
---
```

### Color

A color input combined with a text input. Using the color picker will choose a color as a hex value. Using the text input will allow any valid [CSS color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value).

![Color example](/type-color-example.png)

```yaml
---
eye color: "#0b4660"
---
```

### Date custom

A date input where the displayed date can be set to a custom format.

The actual value written to the note's fronmatter will be `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD[T]HH:MM:SS`.

![Date custom example](/type-datecustom-example.png)

```yaml
---
start date: 2025-10-15
---
```

### Markdown

A live-preview markdown editor. It is the same editor that is used in the body of notes.

![Markdown example](/type-markdown-example.png)

```yaml
---
pangram: A *quick* brown fox **jumps** over the ==lazy== dog
---
```

### Multi-Select

Similar to the built-in [list type](https://help.obsidian.md/properties#List), but it does not allow duplicates, has customizable dynamic or manually defined options, and more.

![Multi-Select example](/type-multiselect-example.png)

```yaml
---
fruits:
  - bananas
  - grapes
---
```

### Numeric

An input which is evaulated as a mathematical expression and can be rounded to a configurable number of decimal places. The variable `x` can be used to represent the current value.

![Numeric example before](/type-numeric-example-before.png)
![Numeric example after](/type-numeric-example-after.png)

```yaml
---
savings: "25807.82"
---
```

### Object

Renders an object of keys and values as sub-properties nested within the parent property. Each sub-property is rendered as if it's a property named `<parent>.<sub_property>`, i.e. `project.status`.

![Object example](/type-object-example.png)

```yaml
---
project:
  status: in progress
  stakeholders:
    - Sandy
    - Patrick
    - Mr. Krabs
---
```

### Rating

A group of icons which act as an input where you select a value along a scale. The icon and count can be customized.

![Rating example](/type-rating-example.png)

```yaml
---
quality: 3
---
```

### Select

A select input where dynamic or manually defined options are available to select for the value. Colors and labels for options can be customized.

![Select example](/type-select-example.png)

```yaml
---
status: in progress
---
```

### Slider

A slider input. The lower and upper limits can be customized.

![Slider example](/type-slider-example.png)

```yaml
---
current HP: 18
---
```

### Time

A time input.

![Time example](/type-time-example.png)

```yaml
---
bedtime: 01:30
---
```

### Toggle

A toggle input. It has only two states (`true` or `false`), unlike the built-in [Checkbox type](https://help.obsidian.md/properties#Checkbox) which technically has three.

![Toggle example](/type-toggle-example.png)

```yaml
---
reviewed: true
---
```
