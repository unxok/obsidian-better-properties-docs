## Metadata Editor

The Metadata Editor refers to the "container" for the rendered properties of a note. This by itself is a built-in to Obsidian.

Below, a CSS snippet (among others) has been added to add an orange border around the Metadata Editor.

Better Properties augments the Metadata Editor to add the features below.

### More button

Opens the menu shown below. Right now there's only these two options, but I have some ideas for more. If you think of something, let me know by [opening a feature request](https://github.com/unxok/obsidian-better-properties/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

#### Show hidden

Toggles the visibility of properties marked as "hidden" in their general property settings.

#### Sort

Sorts the note's properties by the chosen sorting option.

### Resizable label width

Click and drag the border (which is default invisible) between the name and value of a property to resize the width of all property labels in the Metadata Editor. Double click it to reset it back to the default.

This customized width is saved to the plugin settings and applied to all notes.

### Collapsible properties

When hovering over the name of a property, a collapse indicator will show which can be used to hide the value of that property.

### Property Menu

When clicking the icon for a given property, the following menu will be shown. This by itself is built-in to Obsidian.

Better Properties augments this menu by adding or changing the following items.

#### Property type

This built-in item has it's submenu changed such that the types are listed in alphabetical order and types added by the plugin have their icon in your accent color.

#### Settings

This new item opens the settings for the given property. This can also be opened by using the command `Bett Properties: Open property settings`.

Switching to a different tab or closing the modal will save and apply the changed settings.

#### Rename

This new item allows you to mass-update the property name in every note it's used in. The property settings of the previous name will be transferred to the new name.

#### Icon

This new item allows you to override the type icon to shown for this property in the Metadata Editor.

#### Delete

This new item allows you to delete the given property from all notes. A confirmation modal will show before doing the deletion, but be careful because the _deletion is irreversible_
