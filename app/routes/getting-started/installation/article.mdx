## Installation

**Pre installation checklist**

- ✅ Use consistent casing in property names
  - Most features within this plugin (and in Obsidian in general) will treat two property names to be the same if they only differ in the casing of their names, i.e. `myproperty` is equivalent to `MyProperty`. However, this is not 100% consistent across the app, so try to use consistent casing between uses of a property name.
- ✅ **Don't** use a dot (`.`) in property names.
  - Better Properties and Obsidian itself (Bases for example) treat property names with dots in them as if they are a "nested property" (see [Object property type](/features/property-types#object)). Because of this, make sure your existing property names don't have a dot in them.
- ✅ **Dont** use a hastag (`#`) as a sub-property name in object properties.
  - Better Properties uses the syntax `<parent>.#` to store the type and settings for the sub-properties of [Array type](/features/property-types#array) properties, so using a hashtag as a sub-property name in an object may cause unexpected behaviors.
